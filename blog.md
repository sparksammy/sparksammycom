***8/28/17: Server is down... :(***

Server is down due to evacuation away from flooded areas. Server should be back up next Monday if we don't have to move. (might have to, however.

***8/30/17: Plans to prevent future shutdowns...***
I am currently sorting out plans to prevent future server shutdowns, to save bandwidth, and in case I have to get Verizon/Sattelite/Other (similarly priced) internet in the near future. These plans include, but are not limited to:
  - Merging Sparksammy Experimental into Sparksammy.tk (EDIT: now called test site)
  - Using a host for ROFLcraft Minecraft Server (Done, come visit. Will be added too homepage soon.)
  - Making a store to sell my photography and MIDIs. (done. on homepage.)
  - Making sure everything is backed up to the "SparksammyArchive".

***New site plan/Halloween update.***

There will be no more servers. There will only be ROFLCRAFT & Sparksammy Site. However, with bad news comes good news. I have a new store. Also added some "secret links" for you guys to crack open. Enjoy.


***2/15/18: New site design***
I am currently sorting out plans to make a new, more simple website design.
