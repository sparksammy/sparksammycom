story.innerHTML = "So for starters, Oklomsy used to play roblox, in fact thats how we met. Oklomsy was searching for groups to join and to work for, when he suddenly found Sparksammy's group. He was interested in sparksammy's roblox group and he decided to join, oklomsy completed training and got a rank. and when he got a new pc he started helping sparksammy with his games and stuff, at the time there was another person called Dschott, now she was a co-owner of sparksammy's group, don't ask oklomsy (The person who is writing this right now) how they met but they met so they made a heck ton of games together, Sparksammy's group was a little bit popular, we ran roblox advertisements and we got quite a few people, we still made games and one of our proudest achievements was a hotel game. we made a LOT of games. our group was a bit famous and we were happy. it was then that dschott started a different group, Me and oklomsy had to work at both groups so much, it was kinda stressful. so then we decided to quit roblox, we gave our group to someone else and we left roblox completely. We had started experimenting with other languages, however we then decided to make some websites together, we made this website and we made a few others. where we hosted projects together and so much more. this story isn't as entertaining as I thought it was but I really like it! (BTW, Sparksammy writing this: I still tinker around with ROBLOX on time to time, but I don't play with it as much as a game, mostly only do studio.)"
