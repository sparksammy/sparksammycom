    <p>Welcome to sparkSammy.com! My name is Samuel Lord, but you can just call me Sparksammy. However, please spell the brand 'sparkSammy' as sparkSammy. If you see any silly posts from me on social media, they are probably from a long time ago or it's someone pretending to be me, so keep that in mind. Buy my merch if you want, however keep in mind I get only some of the profit, the rest goes to Spreadshirt. Most importantly, enjoy my website!</p>
    <p><i>"Find a balance between freedom, comfort, and flexibility; as there is no such thing as full freedom." -- Sparksammy, 2018</i></p>
